## Assignment_1_Statistical_Measures
This assignment analyzes house prices in Bangalore using the dataset "house_price.csv." The analysis involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), outlier detection and removal using methods like IQR, data visualization through box plots and histograms, and transformation techniques to normalize data. The correlation between numerical features is examined using a heatmap, and scatter plots are utilized to visualize relationships between key variables. The final results help in understanding price trends and improving data quality for better predictive modeling.
## Assignment_2_EDA_and_Preprocessing
This assignment focuses on the end-to-end preprocessing of an employee dataset using Python. It includes data exploration, handling missing values, removing duplicates, identifying outliers through visualization, and analyzing patterns such as age-salary relationships and employee distribution across locations. Categorical features were encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms. Finally, numerical features like Age and Salary were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling across the dataset. This cleaned and transformed data is now ready for further modeling or analysis tasks.
## Assignment_3_Regression
This assignment demonstrates the application of various regression techniques on the California Housing dataset to predict median house values based on multiple housing-related features. The dataset was preprocessed through scaling and checked for missing values to ensure clean input for modeling. Five regression algorithms were implemented—Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR)—each selected for its unique approach to capturing patterns in the data. The models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) metrics to assess and compare performance.
