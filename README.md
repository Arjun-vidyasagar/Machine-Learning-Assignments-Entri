# Machine-Learning-Assignments-Entri
## Assignment_1_Statistical_Measures
This assignment analyzes house prices in Bangalore using the dataset "house_price.csv." The analysis involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), outlier detection and removal using methods like IQR, data visualization through box plots and histograms, and transformation techniques to normalize data. The correlation between numerical features is examined using a heatmap, and scatter plots are utilized to visualize relationships between key variables. The final results help in understanding price trends and improving data quality for better predictive modeling.
## Assignment_2_EDA_and_Preprocessing
This assignment focuses on the end-to-end preprocessing of an employee dataset using Python. It includes data exploration, handling missing values, removing duplicates, identifying outliers through visualization, and analyzing patterns such as age-salary relationships and employee distribution across locations. Categorical features were encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms. Finally, numerical features like Age and Salary were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling across the dataset. This cleaned and transformed data is now ready for further modeling or analysis tasks.
## Assignment_3_Regression
This assignment demonstrates the application of various regression techniques on the California Housing dataset to predict median house values based on multiple housing-related features. The dataset was preprocessed through scaling and checked for missing values to ensure clean input for modeling. Five regression algorithms were implemented—Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR)—each selected for its unique approach to capturing patterns in the data. The models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) metrics to assess and compare performance. 
## Assignment_4_Classification_Problem
This assignment focuses on applying supervised learning classification techniques to the Breast Cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The objective is to evaluate the performance of five popular classification algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—in predicting whether tumors are malignant or benign based on various features. The dataset is first preprocessed with scaling to ensure consistency across features. Each model is trained and tested, and its performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The results are compared to identify the best and worst performing models, providing insights into their suitability for medical diagnosis tasks.
## Assignment_5_Clustering_Algorithm
This assignment applies clustering techniques to the Iris dataset from scikit-learn to demonstrate unsupervised learning methods. The dataset is preprocessed by removing the target (species) column, since clustering is an unsupervised task. Two clustering algorithms are implemented: KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering. KMeans is applied first, with results visualized using PCA for dimensionality reduction. Hierarchical clustering is then performed using Ward’s method, with both a dendrogram and PCA-based cluster visualization. All code is written in Python using libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and scipy. This assessment demonstrates the understanding of clustering concepts and the ability to visualize and interpret clustering results effectively.
## Machine_Learning_Module_End_Project
This project aims to analyze and model car prices in the American market using a dataset of various automobile features. The goal is to identify key factors influencing car pricing and to help a Chinese automobile company make informed decisions when entering the US market. The dataset underwent thorough preprocessing, including feature extraction, correction of brand names, and encoding of categorical variables. Five regression models were implemented—Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor—and their performance was evaluated using R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model with the highest R² and lowest errors. Feature importance analysis highlighted key variables affecting pricing, and hyperparameter tuning further improved the model’s accuracy. This end-to-end analysis provides actionable insights for pricing strategy and market positioning.
